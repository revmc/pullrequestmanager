# pullrequestmanager
====================
This project is for monitoring open pull requests across your repositories in Github.

After logging into Github with your username/password, the user is taken to the Monitored Repositories screen.  The user can selects the repository that they want to monitor and click the "Monitor" button to add it to their list of monitored repositories.  The monitored repositories are sorted in the display by the number of open pull requests in that repository. 

Special thanks to Stefan Winz for suggesting this project to me.
